# HDMI eavesdropping project

**(Development):** Please note, this code-base is in a research state, as it was used for a project. However, I have created a pipeline to simplify a lot of the engine, following SWE principles.

This project will most likely be updated in the future to include the requirements to setup the environment, as I typically use a combination of UV and Conda. Then, also at some point, I imagine I will also streamline some of the experimentation to include it all within the pipeline rather than scratch files.
